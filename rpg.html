	<h2>CRPG's</h2>
		<p>These games have a very different set of rules when it comes to gameplay.
			Combat is usually set on top-down checkered board similar to a chess or
			checkers board. Although, they do not display as a checkered board as they
		  are usually represented with a setting such as a town or wilderness setting
			with a board superimposed upon it. These games also usually allow for a
			greater amount of character manipulation in regards to a characters background,
			stats, attributes, and personality.
